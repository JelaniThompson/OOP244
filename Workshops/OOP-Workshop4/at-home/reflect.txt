1. Safe empty state means that each member value has been initialized.

2. Multiple constructors can simplify code by allowing clients to
initialize objects based on specific needs. In the case of passengers,
it allows clients to leave date in the safe empty state if it did not 
need to be changed.

3. I learned how to overload constructors.
